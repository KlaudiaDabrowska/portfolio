              I live in Gda≈Ñsk (Poland), I am a logistics engineer by education
              but I have never worked in the profession. Since the beginning of
              2021 I have been learning to program. I am self-taught person
              which started with tutorials on youtube and udemy.
              <p className="italic card-text mt-4">
                * From October 2021 I am a student of a postgraduate degree,
                Junior Web Developer.
              </p>
              <p className="italic card-text">
                * From November 2021 to February 2021, I participated in Dare IT
                mentoring. Under the watchful eye of a wonderful mentor, I
                expanded my knowledge and skills.

              <p className="italic card-text mb-4">
                * In March 2022 I took part in a intership at ElPassion, which
                allowed me to learn not only how to code, but how to work as a
                coder (teamwork, git, tests, time estimates).
              </p>
              Privately, I am a mother of a dachshund, a fan of rock concerts,
              and a pole dance enthusiast.
